        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Welcome to TalentSync!</p>

        <p>
          These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the
          use of TalentSync's Website, located at https://talentsync.work.
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing this website we assume you accept these terms and
          conditions. Do not continue to use TalentSync if you do not agree to
          take all of the terms and conditions stated on this page.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <p>
          TalentSync provides global talent sourcing, vetting, and matching services. Scope of work for each project will be defined in a separate Statement
          of Work (SoW).
        </p>

        <h3>2. Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Project fees are determined based on the scope. Unless otherwise
          stated, a 50% upfront payment is required to begin work. Remaining
          amounts are tied to milestone completions or monthly retainers. Late
          payments may result in service delays or penalties.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
          All intellectual property developed specifically for the Client will
          be transferred upon final payment. TalentSync reserves the right to
          reuse non-client-specific tools, frameworks, or methodologies.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>
          TalentSync and the Client agree to maintain the confidentiality of all
          proprietary or sensitive information exchanged throughout the
          engagement. This obligation continues post-termination.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Timelines & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          While we strive to meet all timelines, delivery dates may shift due to
          client-side delays, changes in scope, or technical dependencies. The
          Client agrees to provide timely access, decisions, and assets required
          for development.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Revisions & Scope Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Revisions within the original scope are accommodated. Any additional
          requirements may incur extra charges and updated timelines. Scope
          changes must be agreed to in writing.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Warranties & Bug Fixes</h3>
        <p>
          TalentSync offers a 30-day bug-fix warranty after project delivery.
          Bugs caused by third-party systems, improper usage, or changes to
          requirements post-launch are not covered under warranty.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Termination</h3>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate this agreement with 7 days’ written notice.
          Work completed up to the termination date will be invoiced
          accordingly. Upon termination, TalentSync will deliver all applicable
          assets to the Client.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
          TalentSync is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
          damages including, but not limited to, data loss, missed business
          opportunities, or third-party service failures.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Use of Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
          TalentSync may display non-confidential elements of a project in our
          portfolio or marketing channels. If you prefer to opt-out, notify us
          in writing.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>
          This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with
          the laws of India.
          Disputes arising will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
          courts in that jurisdiction.
